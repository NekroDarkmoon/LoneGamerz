          Rules and Regulations
        </h2>
        <p class="info__content">
          As a member of this clan, you are to:
          <ol>
            <li><span class="content--title">Show utmost respect towards all others at any point in time</span>
              <br>We, as members of the internet, should observe this simple rule at all times. Not only your clan-mates, or seniors, but any fellow human being in Warframe. If you suspect someone is an alien, respect him anyway.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Refrain from spamming</span>
              <br>You are spamming if you send multiple messages extremely quickly and are met with obvious displeasure, usually in the form of annoyance. Otherwise, you may be sending clone messages without any proper purpose.
Failure to halt, even if it was not ill-intended, will be considered spamming. This will be dealt on a case by case basis, and we encourage you to report any such offense (see below).</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Refrain from malicious trolling</span><br>
              Well-meant jokes are shared all the time, but when you fail to stop despite the annoyance of the trolled, you will be considered guilty.
Trolls that rely on unwitting or unwillingly unfair trades are one step too far. People love their money.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Never rage</span><br>
              All of us will have to blow off some steam at some time in our lives. Warframe is not the right time.
In Warframe, we aim to all have fun. Don't rage at another person's expense. To this end, an angry tone will be tolerated, but rage of density more than your idiocy will not. Lets make Warframe a place where we can game in peace.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">WIKI is love WIKI is life</span><br>
              If you're new to the game do read the wiki and not ask about every single detail you come across. We love helping others out but come on you cant expect us to explain how going into a mission works <3 .</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Refrain from sending unappreciated invites</span><br>
              No one likes to be spammed with invites when they clearly dont want to accept them. So do yourself a favour and ask before sending out invires to clan members. Violation of this rule will result in chat ban.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">NOT</span>
              say every fucking sentence with fuck put at every fucking 4-word interval like its the fucking end of the fucking world.
That's an example. Don't follow it.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">DO NOT</span>
              take everything to heart.
We all crack jokes, some might be hilarious some might be offensive. But the key word here is JOKE, its all a joke there is no harm intended within the minds of these people. But if you're still taking offence at these silly jokes just send any overseer a PM and they'll be happy to give you a 24 hour chat ban so you dont have to go through said torture. Love from all.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Speak English</span><br>
              This is less of a rule and more of an encouragement. Failure to comply results in YOUR DEA- A pm from one of us with a smiley in it along with a cute 1 hour ban from chat. Enjoy your silence.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">Anyone offline for 30 days or more will be kicked.</span><br>
              To get extra time, simply send an email or message on discord/ingame/forums to any of the Overseers or Elders and if you were kicked, sending a message will re-admit you back into the clan.</li>
            <li><span class="content--title">You will worship the Senpais.</span><br>
              Actually, don't.</li>
